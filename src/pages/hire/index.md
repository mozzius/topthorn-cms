Topthorn holds regular arena hire days with hour slots. The arena will be set with a full course of show jumps, unless it is advertised as a flatwork day. All bookings are made online and paid for in advance by BACs.

- £25 to hire for one hour for one horse/rider and a further £5 per additional horse/rider.

Please note that first aid is not available on arena hire days so you must bring one helper.
It is also possible to hire the whole venue for a day. Please email [topthornarena@gmail.com](mailto:topthornarena@gmail.com) to check availability and pricing.
