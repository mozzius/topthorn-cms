Topthorn holds regular arena hire days with hour slots. The arena will be set with a full course of show jumps, unless it is advertised as a flatwork day. All bookings are made online and paid for in advance by BACs.

- £20 to hire for one hour for one horse/rider and a further £5 per additional horse/rider.

Please note that first aid is not available on arena hire days so you are advised to bring one helper. Booking represents acceptance of the site's terms and conditions.

It is also possible to hire the whole venue for a day. Please email [topthornarena@gmail.com](mailto:topthornarena@gmail.com) to check availability and pricing.
