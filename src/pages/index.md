    title: Showjumping
    text: Unaffiliated showjumping has always been popular at Topthorn, and our
      fortnightly Friday night showjumping evenings are often a first
      competition for local riders or a useful informal training show for young
      riders and/or horses.  Our regular Mini to Metre showjumping competitions
      offer smaller heights in the morning, up to 1m in the afternoon with more
      fillers. Our showjumping shows offer a friendly competition environment,
      giving an encouraging experience to horse and rider.

      run regular unaffiliated dressage shows starting at Intro level and plenty
      of training opportunities throughout the year to progress your skills and

Topthorn Arena is a friendly equestrian centre in the heart of Suffolk, easily accessible from every corner of East Anglia. We welcome both professional and amateur riders, pony clubs, riding associations and coaches. Our aim is to encourage all levels of riding by providing a range of training opportunities and competition experiences.

We are an affiliated British Dressage venue with regular unaffiliated showjumping and dressage shows, as well as a full programme of popular clinics and arena hire days.

Both the indoor and outdoor arenas have been recently resurfaced by Equestrian Surfaces and the site benefits from plenty of parking and a viewing area. The indoor arena is 63m x 24m and the outdoor arena is 60m x 24m, and we have full sets of both BSJA and working hunter jumps available.
