Topthorn Arena was established in 2009 and has been a firm favourite for East Anglian riders ever since. When it changed ownership in 2018, the site was upgraded with new arena surfaces and a fresh rebranding for its new chapter.

The site also houses a separate livery business, Millbank Livery, and is the home of the Newman family.

Topthorn was named after the original owner's grandfather's popular showjumping horse who was a WWI War Horse (one of the inspirations for Michael Morpurgo's Topthorn in his novel _War Horse_).

## Facilities

The indoor arena is 63m x 24m and has been recently resurfaced with Cushion Track by Equestrian Surfaces. It benefits from a viewing area and judges' boxes for showjumping and dressage.

The outdoor arena is 60m x 24m and was resurfaced in 2020 with silicon sand and mixed fibre by Equestrian Surfaces. The site also has a grass show field available for summer hire.
